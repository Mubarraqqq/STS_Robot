--- About Bruce ---
Bruce is an intelligent voice assistant powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). 
He combines speech recognition, document retrieval, and large language models to provide 
intelligent, context-aware responses. Bruce can answer questions about his knowledge base, 
tell the time and date, and maintain natural conversations.

--- How RAG Works ---
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) combines document retrieval with language generation.
When you ask a question:
1. The system converts your question into a numerical embedding
2. It searches a vector database (FAISS) for similar documents
3. It retrieves the most relevant information chunks
4. It uses this context to generate an informed response
5. The response incorporates both the retrieved knowledge and the AI's capabilities

This approach ensures accuracy and grounds responses in actual knowledge.

--- Technology Stack ---
Bruce uses several advanced technologies:
- Wake Word Detection: Picovoice Porcupine detects "Hey Bruce" command
- Speech Recognition: Google Speech-to-Text converts audio to text
- RAG System: OpenAI embeddings + FAISS vector search for retrieval
- Language Model: Groq API with Gemma2-9B for fast inference
- Text-to-Speech: pyttsx3 for natural voice output
- Python Libraries: Speech Recognition, SoundDevice, NumPy, Scikit-learn

--- Company Background ---
This project demonstrates advanced AI integration for conversational interfaces.
It showcases best practices in:
- Modular software architecture
- Vector database operations
- API integration
- Voice interface design
- Information retrieval systems

--- Data Privacy ---
All user interactions are processed locally where possible. API calls are made to:
- OpenAI (for embeddings only, not conversation content)
- Groq (for language generation)
- Google (for speech recognition)
No personal data is permanently stored by Bruce.

--- Features Explained ---
1. Wake Word Detection - Bruce only activates when you say "Hey Bruce"
2. Continuous Conversation - Once activated, Bruce stays ready for multiple questions
3. Context Awareness - Bruce remembers recent conversation to maintain context
4. Smart Confidence - Different response strategies based on knowledge match quality
5. Graceful Timeouts - Conversation ends after 60 seconds of inactivity
6. Special Commands - Instant responses for time/date queries without RAG
7. Personality - Consistent, friendly tone across all interactions

--- Getting Started ---
To use Bruce:
1. Make sure all API keys are configured in the .env file
2. Prepare your knowledge base in info.txt
3. Run python S2S_v10.py to start the assistant
4. Say "Hey Bruce" to activate
5. Ask questions naturally
6. Say "goodbye" or wait 60 seconds to end conversation

--- Customization Options ---
Users can customize:
- System personality and tone (in prompt_manager.py)
- Response templates for different confidence levels
- Knowledge base content (in info.txt)
- Speech recognition sensitivity settings
- Text-to-speech rate and volume
- RAG retrieval parameters and thresholds
- Conversation timeout duration

--- Troubleshooting Tips ---
If you experience issues:
- Use rag_diagnostics.py to check system health
- Verify all API keys are correct in .env
- Ensure info.txt exists and contains content
- Check that your microphone is working properly
- Reduce background noise for better speech recognition
- Review console logs for specific error messages
- Test individual components independently

--- Performance Optimization ---
For best performance:
- First run will be slower due to embedding generation
- Subsequent runs use cached indices for faster loading
- Keep knowledge base focused and well-organized
- Monitor API usage to manage costs
- Use specific, well-written content in knowledge base
- Test prompts before deploying changes

--- Advanced Usage ---
Power users can:
- Import rag_system.py in other projects
- Create custom retrieval strategies
- Add new prompt templates
- Integrate with other systems
- Build web interfaces using the modules
- Implement custom confidence thresholds
- Add specialized domain knowledge

--- Future Enhancements ---
Planned improvements:
- Multi-language support
- Local embedding models
- Web dashboard interface
- Persistent conversation logs
- User-specific knowledge bases
- Advanced RAG with re-ranking
- Voice activity detection
- Custom wake word training
- Integration with external APIs
- Database backend support

--- Architecture Benefits ---
The modular design provides:
- Testable, independent components
- Reusable modules for other projects
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy maintenance and updates
- Scalable foundation
- Professional code quality
- Comprehensive documentation

--- Best Practices ---
Follow these recommendations:
- Keep .env file private and secure
- Regularly update your knowledge base
- Monitor API costs and usage
- Test changes with diagnostics
- Document any customizations
- Back up your knowledge base
- Use version control for code
- Review logs for errors
