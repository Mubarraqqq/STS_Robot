WORK DONE SO FAR:
NCAIR has undertaken several significant initiatives in Artificial Intelligence & Robotics. They
are actively fine-tuning Llama2 for specific Nigerian purposes, with an initial focus on Nigerian
trade, utilizing a Nigerian trade dataset spanning 20 years and Social Connectedness Data from
Meta. The plan is to open-source the next version of Llama 2, making it freely available for
research and commercial use, including model weights and starting code for pretrained and
conversational fine-tuned versions. NCAIR is also employing Machine Learning to identify top AI
researchers of Nigerian descent by analyzing academic publications, conference presentations,
patents, citation counts, collaboration networks, publication venues, and work impact to pinpoint
significant contributors to the AI field. In collaboration with Design Lab (CcHUB), NCAIR
proposes leveraging Meta Llama 3 LLM to create a digital platform for verifying and validating
products within Nigeria's pharmaceutical value chain, addressing issues like drug counterfeiting,
inefficient distribution, and real-time data aggregation. The National Artificial Intelligence
Research Scheme is a grant program supporting 45 AI researchers in areas such as
Agriculture, Education, Healthcare, Utility, and Sustainability. Additionally, NCAIR has granted
funding for 10 demonstration projects focused on applying Fourth Industrial Revolution
Technologies to Agriculture. Finally, the AI Collective, a community of Artificial Intelligence
experts of Nigerian descent, is dedicated to supporting the national AI agenda.

AI FUND IN COLLABORATION WITH GOOGLE:
NCAIR, in collaboration with Google, has launched an AI Fund aimed at supporting innovation
in Artificial Intelligence within Nigeria. The fund's purpose is to unlock AI's full potential in Nigeria
by nurturing the next generation of AI-powered startups, recognizing AI's global role in
transforming industries, driving innovation, efficiency, economic growth, and new business
models. Nigeria, with Africa's largest economy, a vibrant technology ecosystem, and a youthful,
tech-savvy population, is poised for growth; the fund addresses funding constraints and
resource limitations faced by Nigerian startups. The N100 million fund will empower 10 Nigerian
startups that leverage AI in their technology products. These startups will receive financial
support through grant funding of up to ₦10 million each , access to Google AI tools, resources,
and mentorship from Google engineers for technical expertise , and connection to Google's
extensive network with opportunities for global exposure. The virtual program will run for 6
weeks, from October 2024 to November 2024. Selected startups will focus on diverse areas
such as predicting demand and matching blood types for Africa’s blood supply needs (AI-driven)
, centralizing and personalizing customer engagement for businesses (AI-driven platform) ,
enabling seamless text-to-speech and speech-to-text AI functionality in 13 languages across
underserved regions , supporting livestock farmers with disease detection and climate control
(AI-driven) , streamlining lending operations using AI , connecting global companies with vetted
African tech talent through AI-driven pre-classification and job matching , optimizing sustainable
power for underserved users (AI-powered energy management) , AI-driven healthcare
documentation with tailored tools for Nigerian doctors , providing contextual security insights for
African communities (AI-driven) , and streamlining credit analysis for MSMEs using AI.

AI COLLECTIVE:
The Nigerian AI Collective envisions a future where Nigeria effectively utilizes the power of AI to
foster economic prosperity, innovation, and social development, thereby establishing itself as a
leading force in AI for global good, both on the African continent and internationally. The
objectives of this collective include knowledge sharing and collaboration, facilitating a platform
for AI professionals, researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders to exchange insights, best
practices, and research findings, and fostering cooperation among academia, industry, and
government agencies to strengthen the AI ecosystem. Capacity building is another objective,
involving the development and implementation of training programs, workshops, and seminars
to enhance the skills of AI practitioners and enthusiasts, and encouraging continuous learning to
keep pace with advancements in AI technologies. The collective also aims to promote
innovation and research by supporting AI-focused research and development initiatives that
address local challenges and contribute to global AI knowledge, and by encouraging the
creation of AI startups and incubators to drive innovation across various sectors. Policy
advocacy is a crucial aspect, involving collaboration with policymakers to develop AI-friendly
regulations and policies that create a conducive environment for AI research, development, and
application, while also advocating for ethical AI practices and responsible use of AI technologies
in alignment with global standards. Finally, international collaboration is a key objective, focusing
